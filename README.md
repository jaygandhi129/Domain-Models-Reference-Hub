# Domain Models Reference Hub


A simple, minimalist, and easy-to-use wiki site for referencing domain models from various industries.

## Overview

This project hosts a centralized reference site listing major domain models. Each domain model entry includes a short description, links to official model categories/types, and relevant references. The site is built to be:

- **Minimalistic and clean** for easy navigation  
- **Searchable** to quickly find domain models  
- **Data-driven** with content stored in JSON for easy updates  
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages** for free and fast access
